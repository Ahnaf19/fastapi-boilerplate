## Docker Build & Run

To build and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

---

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

#### Build Docker Image

> [!IMPORTANT] > `Docker Daemon` or `Docker Desktop` must be running while building Docker Image.

Navigate to the root directory of the repo where the `Dockerfile` is located and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t <project_name>:latest .
```

#### Run Docker Container

After building the Docker image, you can run it using the following command:

```sh
docker run -dp 8000:8000 <project_name>:latest
```

or give the container a name:

```sh
docker run -dp 8000:8000 --name <project_name>-latest <project_name>:latest
```

This will start the application in a Docker container. The application can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000` e.g. `127.0.0.1:8000`

> [!NOTE] > `-dp` (`-d` & `-p`) tag runs the container in detached mode (in the background, terminal is available to use right away) and container port `8000` is mapped to local port `8000`.

#### Stopping the Container

To stop the running container, first find the container ID using:

```sh
docker ps
```

Then stop the container using:

```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```

## Run locally with Uvicorn

- [optional but recommended] create a venv and activate it
- Install dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- start Uvicorn server:
  ```sh
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```
- `ctrl+c` to break the server.
